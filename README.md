How To Run:

1) Install the necessary imports

2) Given you have the necessary imports run 'python main.py' or 'python3 main.py' 

3) It should take a bit to load the data and create the embeddings and then ask you to enter your error code question

4) You can either enter an actual OBD code such as 'P0562' or an actual problem like 'I am hearing a tapping noise'

5) In order to end the conversation enter 'exit' which will take you to the 'Enter your error code question' line

6) Enter exit again to leave the program as a whole
